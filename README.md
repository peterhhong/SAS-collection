# SAS-collection

This is a collection of SAS codes

The goal of this collection to have a set of SAS codes that you can use for various tasks. In future iterations
when time allows, I would seek the opportunity to add in equivalent coding for other languages such as R and Python
as both are widely used for Data analysis and other Data related projects.


Some of the topics included are 

1. How to create a dataset, and how to view a dataset.
2. How to import a dataset into SAS.
3. How to manipulate variables.
4. Descriptive statistics.
